# GWG-FEND-Portfolio

## Project Description
I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio project completed throughout the Google-Udacity FEND Nanodegree program.

The design mockup is located [here.](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/45/start)
My Codepen deployment is located [here.](https://codepen.io/MoHampton/full/zjRgaZ/)
